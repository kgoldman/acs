json note
---------

The distros can't seem to decide whether the json include directory is
/usr/include/json or /usr/include/json-c.

I use /usr/include/json.  If your distro uses json-c, just make a soft link:

# cd /usr/include
# ln -s json-c json

Build Libraries and Applications
--------------------------------

The makefiles and these instructions assume that the TSS is built in
../utils.  If not, adjust accordingly.  When the TSS is installed in
/usr/lib as part of a distribution, this becomes unnecessary.

1 - If using a SW TPM

https://sourceforge.net/projects/ibmswtpm2/

> cd .../tpm2/src
> make

2 - TSS and utilities:  creates libtss.so

https://sourceforge.net/projects/ibmtpm20tss/

	For a TPM 2.0 TSS

> cd .../tpm2/utils
> make -f makefiletpm20

	For a combined TPM 1.2 and TPM 2.0 TSS

> cd .../tpm2/utils
> make -f makefiletpmc
> cd .../tpm2/utils12
> make -f makefiletpmc

3 - Since the TSS is not "installed", the ACS programs must point
to the TSS library [path].  When the TSS is installed in /usr/lib as
part of a distribution, this step becomes unnecessary.

csh variants

> setenv LD_LIBRARY_PATH [path]/tpm2/utils:[path]/tpm2/utils12

bash variants

> export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=[path]/tpm2/utils:[path]/tpm2/utils12

4 - Attestation demo

# mkdir /var/www/html/acs
# chown user /var/www/html/acs
# chgrp user /var/www/html/acs
# chmod 777  /var/www/html/acs

> cd .../tpm2/acs

For TPM 2.0 client and server

> make

For TPM 1.2 client (requires TPM 1.2 / TPM 2.0 server)

> make -f makefiletpm12

For TPM 1.2 and TPM 2.0 client and TPM 1.2 / TPM 2.0 server

> make -f makefiletpmc
	
	These notes are not required once the TSS is installed in the
	system area through a package manager.

	The makefile assumes that the TSS include and library
	directories are in ../utils.  If not, specify that [path].

	> setenv CPATH [path-to]/tpm2/utils
	> setenv LIBRARY_PATH [path-to]/tpm2/utils

	For TPM 1.2

	> setenv CPATH [path-to]/tpm2/utils:[path-to]/tpm2/utils12
	> setenv LIBRARY_PATH [path-to]/tpm2/utils:[path-to]/tpm2/utils12
	
#ifdef ACS_BLOCKCHAIN
	For the blockchain demo, add to the makefile CCFLAGS
		-DACS_BLOCKCHAIN
	To omit that code, remove that line
#endif


Provision the RSA EK Certificate CA Signing Key
-----------------------------------------------

*** This optional step is only required if changing the endorsement
    key CA signing key cakey.pem / cacert.pem included in the package.

*** This is done once per software install.  

*** This is only required when using a SW TPM.

1 - Create an EK certificate server CA signing key

> cd .../tpm2/acs
> openssl genrsa -out cakey.pem -aes256 -passout pass:rrrr 2048

2 - Create a self signed EK root CA certificate

> openssl req -new -x509 -key cakey.pem -out cacert.pem -days 3650

Country Name (2 letter code) [XX]:US
State or Province Name (full name) []:NY
Locality Name (eg, city) [Default City]:Yorktown
Organization Name (eg, company) [Default Company Ltd]:IBM
Organizational Unit Name (eg, section) []:
Common Name (eg, your name or your server's hostname) []:EK CA         
Email Address []:

3 - View the certificate for correctness.  

> openssl x509 -text -in cacert.pem -noout

Issuer and subject should match.  Validity 20 years.  Etc.

4 - Install the cacert.pem in the directory where the HW TPM root
certificates are.  Currently, that's .../tpm2/utils/certificates.

The HW TPM vendor root certificates should already be there.

Provision the EC EK Certificate CA Signing Key
----------------------------------------------

*** This optional step is only required if changing the endorsement
    key CA signing key cakeyecc.pem / cacertecc.pem included in the
    package.

*** This optional step requires at least openssl 1.0.2. 1.0.1 will not
    work.

> openssl genpkey -out cakeyecc.pem -outform PEM -pass pass:rrrr -aes256 -algorithm ec -pkeyopt ec_paramgen_curve:prime256v1 -pkeyopt ec_param_enc:named_curve

2 - Create a self signed EK root CA certificate

> openssl req -new -x509 -key cakeyecc.pem -out cacertecc.pem -days 3650

Country Name (2 letter code) [XX]:US
State or Province Name (full name) []:NY
Locality Name (eg, city) [Default City]:Yorktown
Organization Name (eg, company) [Default Company Ltd]:IBM
Organizational Unit Name (eg, section) []:
Common Name (eg, your name or your server's hostname) []:EK EC CA         
Email Address []:

3 - View the certificate for correctness.  

openssl x509 -text -in cacertecc.pem -noout

Issuer and subject should match.  Validity 20 years.  Etc.

4 - Install the cacertecc.pem in the directory where the HW TPM root
certificates are.  Currently, that's .../tpm2/utils/certificates.


SW TPM Provisioning
-----------------------

*** This is only required for a SW TPM.  HW TPMs come with EK
    certificates.

*** This is only required once per TPM.  It is installed in SW TPM
    non-volatile memory.

TPM 2.0
- - - -

The TSS will normally default to these.

	setenv TPM_COMMAND_PORT 2321
	setenv TPM_SERVER_TYPE mssim

1 - Start the SW TPM

.../tpm2/src> tpm_server
.../tpm2/utils> powerup;startup

2 - Provision the SW TPM with EK certificates

(RSA public key and CA key)


.../tpm2/utils> createekcert -rsa 2048 -cakey cakey.pem -capwd rrrr -v

(EC public key and CA key)

.../tpm2/utils> createekcert -ecc nistp256 -cakey cakeyecc.pem -capwd rrrr -caalg ec -v

CAUTION.  The EK and certificate will normally persist.  However,
running the TSS regression test rolls the EPS (endorsement hierarchy
primary seed), voiding everything.  You can reprovision and re-enroll,
but it's easier to make a copy of the SW TPM NV space now, and restore
it as necessary.

> cd .../tpm2/src
> cp NVChip NVChip.save

TPM 1.2
- - - -

setenv TPM_COMMAND_PORT 6543
setenv TPM_SERVER_TYPE rawsingle
setenv TPM_ENCRYPT_SESSIONS 0

1 - Start the SW TPM

Remove the 00.permall state file, so that an EK certificate index can be defined with the D bit set

.../tpm/src> tpm_server >! tpm.log

2 - Startup, Create an EK, create an SRK, use the default all zeros SRK password

.../utils12> tpminit; startup

.../utils12> createendorsementkeypair

.../utils12> oiap

.../utils12> takeownership -pwdo ooo -se0 [handle from OIAP] 0

2 - Provision the SW TPM with EK certificates.  Does the following

	starts an OSAP session and uses it to define the EK certificate NV index
	secures the NV space
	reads the EK public key
	creates and provisions the EK certificate
	reads the certificate back for testing

All in the .../utils12 directory

$OSAP is the handle from the OSAP command
$OIAP is the handle from the OIAP command

> osap -ha 40000001 -pwd ooo

> nvdefinespace -ha 1000f000 -sz 1400 -per 20002 -se0 $OSAP 0

> nvdefinespace -ha ffffffff -sz 0

> oiap

> ownerreadinternalpub -ha ek -pwdo ooo -op ekpub.bin -se0 $OIAP 0

> createekcert -pwdo ooo -iek ekpub.bin -of ekcert.der -cakey ../utils/cakey.pem -capwd rrrr

> oiap

> nvreadvalue -ha 1000f000 -pwdo ooo -cert -se0 $OIAP 0

Provisioning the server
-----------------------

*** This is only required if changing privacy CA signing key
pcakey.pem/ pcacert.pem  included in the package.

1 - Create a privacy CA signing key

> cd .../tpm2/acs
> openssl genrsa -out pcakey.pem -aes256 -passout pass:rrrr 2048

2 - Create a self signed privacy CA certificate

> openssl req -new -x509 -key pcakey.pem -out pcacert.pem -days 3560

Use AK CA as the common name

3 - View the certificate for correctness.

> openssl x509 -text -in pcacert.pem -noout

Start the server
----------------

1 - The server uses a TPM as a crypto coprocessor.  It must point to a
different (typically a software) TPM and TSS data directory.

A - If the server is being run on the same machine as the client:

> cd .../tpm2/acs
	for example
> export TPM_DATA_DIR=/gsa/yktgsa/home/k/g/kgold/tpm2
	or
> setenv TPM_DATA_DIR /gsa/yktgsa/home/k/g/kgold/tpm2

B - If the server is being run on a different machine from the client:

	(and TPM 2.0 attestation key provisioning is needed)

> .../tpm2/src/tpm_server
> .../tpm2/utils/powerup
> .../tpm2/utils/startup

2 - Edit the file .../tpm2/utils/certificates/rootcerts.txt

Change the path name to wherever the directory is installed.

#ifdef ACS_BLOCKCHAIN

3 - Only if sending enrollment data to the blockchain server:

Set the environment variables

ACS_BC_SERVER	(default to localhost)
ACS_BC_PORT	(default to 5000)
ACS_BC_URL	(default chaincode)

For testing without the blockchain server, use the chaincode.php web page

setenv ACS_BC_SERVER localhost
setenv ACS_BC_PORT 80
setenv ACS_BC_URL acs/chaincode.php

#endif

4 - Set the server port

setenv ACS_PORT	2323

5 - Optional: Set the mysql userid/password

The mysql instructions above don't set a DB host and port, userid and
password, or database name.  However if you have one set in your
configuration you can set it using these environment variables.

ACS_SQL_HOST - defaults to localhost
ACS_SQL_PORT - defaults to 0, MySQL will use its default
ACS_SQL_USERID - defaults to current user
ACS_SQL_PASSWORD - defaults to empty
ACS_SQL_DATABASE - defaults to tpm2


6 - Start the attestation server.

E.g.,

> server -v -root ../utils/certificates/rootcerts.txt -imacert imakey.der >! serverenroll.log4j

-v and piping to a file are optional.

Client Setup
-------------

Set the TSS environment variables (e.g. TPM_INTERFACE_TYPE) if a
client HW TPM is being used.  See the TSS docs.

Optionally, set ACS_DIR to an existing directory where the ACS clients
store the AK private and public keys.

Provisioning a Client
---------------------

NOTE: With a hardware TPM, this can take several minutes, and appear
to hang.  Creating a primary key on a hardware TPM is a long calculation.

This installs the client attestation key certificate at the
attestation server.

TPM 2.0
- - - -

> clientenroll -alg rsa -v -ho cainl.watson.ibm.com -co akcert.pem >! clientenroll.log4j

or a different machine with EC. rsa takes an optional bit strength value.

> clientenroll -alg ec -v -ho cainl.watson.ibm.com -ma cainlec.watson.ibm.com -co akeccert.pem >! clientenroll.log4j

where -ho is the hostname of the server, and is optional for
localhost. ec takes an optional curve specifier.

-v and piping to a file are optional.

TPM 1.2
- - - -

> clientenroll12 -pwdo ooo -co akcert12.pem -v

Running an Attestation
----------------------

*** One time per client reboot, if the client does not have an event
log (and none do today), and the PCRs are uninitialized, extend the
test event log tpm2bios.log into the TPM PCRs.  If the firmware has
already extended the PCRs, the event log will not match.

TPM 2.0
- - - -

tpm2bios.log is a sample event log.

> .../utils/eventextend -if tpm2bios.log -tpm -v >! b.log4j

imasig.log is a sample IMA log

> .../utils/imaextend -if imasig.log -le -v > ! i.log4j

As often as desired, run an attestation.

> client -alg rsa -ifb tpm2bios.log -ifi imasig.log -ho cainl.watson.ibm.com -v >! client.log4j

or

> client -alg ec -ifb tpm2bios.log -ifi imasig.log -ho cainl.watson.ibm.com -v -ma cainlec.watson.ibm.com >! client.log4j

where -ho is the hostname of the server, and is optional for
localhost.

TPM 1.2
- - - -

> .../utils12//eventextend -if tpmbios.log -tpm

> .../utils12/imaextend -if imasig.log -le

As often as desired, run an attestation.

> client12 -ifb tpmbios.log -ifi imasig.log -v

Code Structure
--------------

The client side are separated into the main client and clientenroll
executables and a clientlocal set of utilities.

The structure permits the client and clientenroll functions to be run
in a different space (perhaps a VM) than the (clientlocal) space that
has the TPM.  An interface would have to be provided to pass the
function parameters through.

Minimal TSS
-----------

For a client with a minimal local client environment, build a separate
minimal TSS.

> cd .../utils

To run with a HW TPM on a platform with no socket library, add to CCFLAGS
	-DTPM_NOSOCKET

create the minimal TSS for the ACS first, then the fill TSS for the utilities

> make -f makefile.min clean all
> make clean all

build the ACS against the minimal TSS

> cd .../acs

build the server and the test code against the full TSS

> make clean server

build the client code against the minimal TSS

> make -f makefile.min clean all

Clearing a hostname for testing
-------------------------------

delete from machines where hostname = 'cainl.watson.ibm.com';
delete from attestlog where hostname = 'cainl.watson.ibm.com';
delete from imalog where hostname = 'cainl.watson.ibm.com';

delete from machines where hostname = 'cainlec.watson.ibm.com';
delete from attestlog where hostname = 'cainlec.watson.ibm.com';
delete from imalog where hostname = 'cainlec.watson.ibm.com';
